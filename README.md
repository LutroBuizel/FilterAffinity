## Original Description by Spotted Squeak

Filters out unwanted artists/images while browsing on Furaffinity.net.

Ever been browsing all the great art on FurAffinity and come across something you didn't like?  Yeah, me too. So I made this.

Welcome to Filter Affinity!

It filters out content based on artist names and keywords in the submission titles and short descriptions on the Home, Browse, Gallery and Search pages. If you wish to always display artwork by a certain artist, their names can be listed to allow to do just that.

Hovering over a submission thumbnail will show a Add/Remove option box. Clicking the plus(+) symbol adds the artist's name to the filter list automatically. Clicking the minus(-) symbol removes the artist from the filter list.

You can also filter by the submission rating, and even just block out the entire submission or just hide the thumbnail!  Easy!

No longer worry about scarring your eyes with material you'd rather not stumble across.  Try out Filter Affinity today!

## Note from Lutro

Hi, [Lutro here](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/lutro/). I figured that this code would eventually go out of date eventually, with the unfortunate passing of Spotted Squeak. I told myself that I'd try to maintain it. It's the least I could do for the community after losing someone so great. Thankfully, he [published the source code here on GitHub](https://github.com/SpottedSqueak/FilterAffinity). I've since [forked the project](https://github.com/LutroBuizel/FilterAffinity) so I can make updates.

Most of this development was done by Spotted. I'm doing my best to limit my own involvement to just making it work again, whenever FA changes something that makes something here break.

Originally, Spotted had a ko-fi link up in the About tab of the extension. I've removed that, as I'm not sure that account is maintained anymore, and I definitely don't want people spending money that'll go nowhere. If there's some fund of Spotted that is still active, I'll happily link to that instead. Let me know if one does!

See below for links to the available extensions. Obviously, I cannot update the original entries, so I had to make my own.
